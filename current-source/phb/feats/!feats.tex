\section{[Celestial] and [Fiend] Feats} \label{feats:outsider}

A feat with the [Celestial] or [Fiend] tag can only be taken by a creature who is an Outsider. For this purpose, any creature from any upper plane is a Celestial regardless of its alignment, while any creature from any lower plane is a Fiend regardless of its alignment. Further, any elemental or outsider with a Good alignment is a Celestial regardless of its plane of origin., while any elemental or outsider with an Evil alignment is a Fiend regardless of its plane of origin. The abilities granted by feats with the [Celestial] or [Fiend] tag are Extraordinary abilities unless otherwise stated. A Celestial does not gain a Fiendish trait from taking a [Celestial] feat that also has the [Fiend] tag.

\section{[Elemental] Feats} \label{feats:elemental}

A feat with the [Elemental] tag can only be taken by a creature who is from an inner plane or any Elemental or Outsider with an elemental subtype. If the feat has another similar tag (such as [Celestial], [Fey], or [Fiend]), a creature who fulfills the criteria for the other tag may waive this requirement. The abilities granted by feats with the [Elemental] tag are Extraordinary abilities unless otherwise stated.
